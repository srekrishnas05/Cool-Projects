### This repo contains various other projects/code snippets I've worked on ###

My favorite higher level coding language is C++ and once learning SFML, I've liked creating small projects utilizing both. I've created this repo to showcase some of these small coding projects I do. I'm aiming to create projects with other skills as well, which I intend on uploading to this repo! Everything is runnable and instructions are provided for each project.
